## Introduction

Netflix has revolutionized the entertainment industry, and this project aims to gain insights into its content using data analysis techniques. By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas and Plotly, we explore the dataset to uncover trends and patterns within Netflix's offerings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, containing information about Netflix shows and movies. It provides valuable attributes such as titles, directors, cast, release years, and more.

## Getting Started

To explore the Netflix Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/weedu34/Netflix_Analysis`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
4. Load and preprocess the dataset using Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The link to the file is [Notebook](https://github.com/weedu34/Netflix_Analysis/blob/main/data_analysis.ipynb)
5. Run the analysis scripts to generate insights and visualizations.
6. Explore the generated visualizations in the Jupyter Notebook or saved image files.

## Analysis

The analysis covers a wide range of aspects related to Netflix's content, including:
- Distribution of content by release year.
- Director and cast analysis.
- Content duration and release frequency.
- Content released country-wise

## Visualizations

The heart of this project lies in its visualizations. Using the Plotly library, we've created interactive bar graphs, pie charts, and other visual representations that make it easy to grasp the insights gained from the dataset.
